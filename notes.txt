Machine Learning w/ JavaFX

Application: Naive Bayes Spam Filtering

Pull:

* https://github.com/adwansyed/SpamDetection-with-Machine-Learning.git
Open Project "SpamDetection" in IDE (example: IntelliJ IDEA)

* Edit build configurations to point to sample.Main
* Build project
* Run project
Main Success Scenario:

* Select "Training" directory -> ../data/train/
* Select "Testing" directory -> ../data/test/
* Results will populate
Future improvements:

Bag of words bayesian spam detector can be improved by attempting other machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest-Neighbors and other frequent itemset algorithms
Increase training datasets with larger and newer datasets
